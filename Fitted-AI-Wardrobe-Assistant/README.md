## Core Data Models

### ClothingItem
```typescript
interface ClothingItem {
  id: string;
  image: string; // IndexedDB reference
  category: 'top' | 'bottom' | 'shoes' | 'accessory' | 'outerwear';
  colors: string[];
  style?: string[];
  aiAnalysis?: AIClothingAnalysis;
  uploadedAt: Date;
}
```

## Development Highlights

- **Local-First Architecture**: All data stays on device (IndexedDB + localStorage)—no cloud dependencies
- **Adaptive Batch Processing**: 3 concurrent uploads with automatic sequential fallback
- **Image Optimization**: Auto-resize to 1024px before processing
- **Global Weather Integration**: 30-min cached weather, visible across all pages
- **AI Outfit Generation**: GPT-4 powered with graceful fallback to local algorithm
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Adapts to time of day, location, and occasion

## Performance Optimizations

- React.lazy + Suspense for code splitting
- React.memo for ClothingItem and OutfitCard
- useCallback/useMemo for expensive operations
- Image compression (512px, 60% quality for AI)
- **Image resize optimization (1024px before background removal)**
- IndexedDB for efficient image storage
- Background removal cached (WASM model loaded once)
- Weather data cached (30-minute refresh)
- **Adaptive parallel processing (3 concurrent → 1 sequential on errors)**
- **Promise.allSettled for robust batch operations**

## Batch Upload Processing

The batch upload system features intelligent parallel processing:

1. **Start Optimistic**: Processes 3 files concurrently for speed
2. **Monitor for Errors**: Tracks failures in each batch using Promise.allSettled
3. **Fallback to Safe Mode**: Automatically switches to sequential (1 file at a time) when errors occur
4. **Continue Reliably**: All remaining files process one-by-one for maximum stability

This adaptive approach balances speed with reliability, especially important for mobile devices with limited resources.

## Cost Analysis

**Per 100 Images:**
- Background removal: $0 (client-side WASM)
- Image format conversion: $0 (client-side Canvas API)
- Image resize optimization: $0 (client-side Canvas API)
- AI analysis: $0.15 (optional, $0.0015 per image)
- Outfit recommendations: $0.10 ($0.001 per request)

**Total**: ~$0.25 per 100 items analyzed + 100 outfit generations

## Browser Support

- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
